# CSE291A Final Project

## Source Files

We have `l2_loss.py` as our Loma codebase. Within this file we have `l2_loss` and `pyramid_l2_loss` functions.

`main.py` contains our pipeline of constructing polygons and pictures, and optimizing them. Directly running this script is to verify that our Loma version of loss functions work the same as traditional loss functions.

## Task Files

Our first task is to optimize colors and vertices of multiple polygons. To run this, use: `python3.10 task1.py`.

Our second task is to reorder layers of different polygons. To run this, use: `python3.10 task2.py`.

Our third task is to start with a single rectangle and optimize to get the target polygon. To run this, use: `python3.10 task3.py`.

You can directly check their outcomes in exp1-3.
